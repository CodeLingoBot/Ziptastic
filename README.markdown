## About Ziptastic API

Ziptastic API is a super easy to use API that returns the Country, State, City of the ip code you supply. The Ziptastic API was created by [Thomas Schultz](http://github.com/daspecster) and then I ( [Josh Strange](http://github.com/joshstrange)) re-wrote parts of it in PHP using the [SLIM framework](http://www.slimframework.com/) and hosted it here.
